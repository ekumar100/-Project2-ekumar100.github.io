    <h2>My favorite subject</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in science in general. I like how it serves as an answer to life's questions and is often an application of math.</p>
    <h2>Specific Fields in Math</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Physics</li>
      <li>Chemistry</li>
      <li>Biology</li>
      <li>Engineering</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Meteorology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These fields are all very vastly different in that they seek to answer a completely different set of questions of the great unknown of life. Yet, they all unite in this truth, making science both diverse and invaluable to society.</p>
